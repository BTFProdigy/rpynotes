    "Fourier based filtering function can be seen by observing how the Parseval's theorem operates.  We emphasise that in this context, filtering could mean amplifying as well as attenuating a group of group of frequencies.  To filter a signal en masse with this technique is simple enough; for a band pass filter for example.   First, we take the DFT of the signal. Next, we multiply the selected band (whose loer and upper limits are denoted by k_1 and k_h, respectively) by the desired gain factor a, bering in mind that this must be applied to both the real and imaginary terms.\n",
