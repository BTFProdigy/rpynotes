# model parameters
#
# Usage:
#   Training only:
#         Leave all the parameters as they are
#         Disable validation to run a bit faster (set validation=False below)
#         You can follow progress in Tensorboard: tensorboard --log-dir=log
#   Training and experimentation (default):
#         Keep validation enabled
#         You can now play with the parameters anf follow the effects in Tensorboard
#         A good choice of parameters ensures that the testing and validation curves stay close
#         To see the curves drift apart ("overfitting") try to use an insufficient amount of
#         training data (shakedir = "shakespeare/t*.txt" for example)
